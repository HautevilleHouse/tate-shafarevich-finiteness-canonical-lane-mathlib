# tate-shafarevich-finiteness-canonical-lane Lean migration boundary

This module records the source repository boundary and canonical-lane data
structures for the Lean migration. The source package translation lives in
`TateShafarevichFinitenessCanonicalLaneLean/SourcePackage.lean`.

This module records the source boundary and does not assert source-conjecture
closure.
